The file industry codes.txt on the RCV1 CD-ROMs lists a total of 870 codes. Most do not appear
in the documents and at first glance they appear confusing and redundant. As discussed below, only
354 of these codes appear to have been available for use by the coders. We therefore recommend
that only these 354 codes (which we list in Online Appendix 4) be used in experiments.
Of the 354 valid Industry codes, 350 have at least one occurrence in the corpus(in both RCV1-v1
and RCV1-v2). Nonzero category frequencies range from two for I5020030 (RESERVOIR CONSTRUCTION) and I5020050 (SEA DEFENCE CONSTRUCTION) to 34,788 (34,775 in RCV1-v2)
for I81402 (COMMERCIAL BANKING). In contrast to Topic and Region codes, Industry codes
were not required to be assigned. Only a subset of documents (351,812 for RCV1-v1 and 351,761
for RCV1-v2) have them.
The Industry codes incorporate many fine-grained distinctions in subject matter. (For instance,
there are five variations on the real estate industry.) They may therefore provide a test of the ability
of text categorization systems to distinguish small differences in content.
As with Topics, the Industry code symbols encode both a hierarchy and a numeric sort order.
The hierarchy was used for automated assignment of ancestor categories, though these automated
assignments were imperfectly preserved in RCV1 (Section 3.5.2). In addition, some use of relationships between codes for companies (not present in the RCV1 CD-ROMs) and codes for Industries
was used during automated assignment of Industries.
Several anomalies of the morphology of the Industry code symbols, and in the way the codes
were used, make the relationships among codes hard to discern. We first discuss these anomalies,
and then how to deal with them for experimental purposes.
Anomaly 1: The legacy editing interface used by coders required Industry code symbols to
be either six or eight characters, regardless of hierarchy position. For instance, here is a subset of
the codes in the form that editors apparently conceived of them (we indent the codes to indicate
hierarchical structure):
